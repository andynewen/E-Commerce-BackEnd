* MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
* A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data.
* SQL is used by language programmers to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database.

* Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. 

* A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. 

* Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.
